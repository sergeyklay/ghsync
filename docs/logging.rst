Logging
=======

All informational and error messages produced by ``gstore`` are sent directly to
the standard OS streams. ``gstore`` doesn't have any special tools/options to setup
logging to files. Such design was chosen deliberately to not increase ``gstore``
complexity in those aspects where this is not clearly necessary, and also to
simplify its administration by end users.

So, informational and error messages produced by ``gstore`` are sent to two
separate streams:

* The regular output is sent to standard output stream (``STDOUT``)
* The error messages and the warning ones are sent to standard error stream
  (``STDERR``)

The format of the messages generated by ``gstore`` was chosen in such a way as to
preserve human readability, but at the same time to allow specialized tools to
parse message entries according to a single template.

Let's look at a few examples to demonstrate the above:

.. code-block:: bash

   # All messages are visible
   $ gstore ~/backup

   # Only informational message are visible
   $ gstore ~/backup 2>/dev/null

   # Only error messages and warnings are visible
   $ gstore ~/backup 1>/dev/null

   # Store logs separately
   $ gstore ~/backup > info.log 2> err.log

   # Store all the logs in the same file
   $ gstore ~/backup > gstore.log 2>&1

You can control the logging level using the following options:

``-v``, ``--verbose``
  Enable verbose mode. Causes ``gstore`` to print debugging messages about its
  progress in some cases.

``-q``, ``--quiet``
  Silence any informational messages except error ones.
